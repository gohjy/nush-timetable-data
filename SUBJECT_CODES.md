# Subject Codes
Below are the values that should be used for the `subject` field in the data files. If there are conflicting values, the one further up the list takes precedence.

If there are multiple subjects taken by different students, separate them with a comma, for example `PHYS,BIO`.

If a subject is not in this list, please open an issue or pull request.
